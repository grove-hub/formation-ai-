The environment, in a wide sense, should be protect ed, as follows from Article 3(3) TEU \nand Article 191 TFEU, coveri ng all natural resources, including air, water , soil, ecosyste ms, including ecosystem \nservices and functions, and wild fauna and flora, including habitats, as well as services provid ed by natural resources.\n(2) Pursuant to Article 191(2) TFEU, Union policy on  environment is to aim at a high level of prot ection taking into \naccount  diversity of situations in  various regions of  Union. That policy is to be based on  \nprecautionar y principle and on  principles that preventive action is to be take n, that environmental damage \nshould as a priority be rectifi ed at source and that  pollut er should pay. Consider ing that environmental crime \nalso affects fundamental rights,  figh t against environmental crime at Union level is crucial to ensur ing that those \nrights are protect ed.\n(3) The rise in environmental criminal offenc es and their effects, which under mine  effectiveness of Union \nenvironmental law, is a matt er of continuing concer n in  Union. Such offences increasing ly exte nd beyond  \nborders of  Member States in which they are committed. Such offences pose a threat to  environment and \ntheref ore necessitate an appropr iate and effective response, which often requires effective cross-border cooperation.\n(4) The existing rules on penalties under Directive 2008/99/EC of  European Parliament and of  Council (3) and \nunder Union environmental sectoral law have not been sufficient to achieve comp liance with Union law concer ning \nprot ection of  envir onment. Such comp liance should be strengthened by  availability of effective, \npropor tionate and dissuasive criminal penalties that correspond to  gravity of  offences and can conve y more \nsocial disapproval than  use of administrative penalties. Complementarity of criminal and administrative law is \ncrucial to prevent and deter unlawful conduct that damage s  environment.\nOffi cial Jour nal \nof  European UnionEN \nL series\n2024/1203 30.4.2024\nELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2024/1203/oj 1/28(1) OJ C 290, 29.7.2022, p. 143.\n(2) Position of  European Parliament of 27 Febr uary 2024 (not yet published in  Official Jour nal) and decision of  Council of \n26 March 2024.\n(3) Directive 2008/99/EC of  European Parliament and of  Council of 19 Novemb er 2008 on  protection of  environment \nthrough criminal law (OJ L 328, 6.12.2008, p. 28).', '(5) The list of environmental criminal offenc es in Directive 2008/99/EC should be revised and additional criminal \noffences based on  most serious breaches of Union environmental law should be added. Penalties should be \nstrengthened in order to enhance their deterr ent effect, and  effectiveness of  detection, investig ation, \nprosecution and adjudication of environmental criminal offences should be impro ved.\n(6) Member States should criminalise certain unla wful conduct, provide for great er precision with rega rd to  \ndefinition of relevant criminal offences and harmonise types and levels of penalties.\n(7) Failure to comply with a legal duty to act can have  same negative effect on  environment and human health as \nactive conduct. Theref ore,  definition of criminal offences in this Directive should cover both acts and omissions, \nwhere applicable.\n(8) Member States should provid e for criminal penalties in their national law in respect of serious infringem ents of \nUnion law concer ning prot ection of  environment. In  framew ork of  common fisheries policy , Union law \nprovides for a comp rehensive set of rules for control and enforcement under Council Regulations  \nNo 1224/2009 (4) and  No 1005/2008 (5) in  event of serious infringem ents, including those that cause \ndamage to  mar ine environment. Und er that set of rules, Member States have  choice of using administrative \nor criminal penalties, or both. In line with  communications of  Commission of 11 December 2019 on �\x80\x98The \nEuropean Green Deal�\x80\x99 and 20 May 2020 on �\x80\x98EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030. Bringing nature back into our lives�\x80\x99, \ncertain intentional unlawful conduct covered by Regulation  No 1224/2009 and Regulation  No 1005/2008 \nshould be established as a criminal offence.\n(9) In order for conduct to constitute an environmental criminal offence under this Directive, it should be unla wful. In \norder for conduct to be unlawful, it should breach Union law which contr ibut es to pursuit of one of  objectives of \n Union�\x80\x99s policy on  environment as set out in Article 191(1) TFEU, irrespective of  lega l basis of such Union \nlaw, which could include, for exam ple, Article 91, 114, 168 or 192 TFEU, or should breach laws, regulations or \nadministrative provis ions of a Member State, or decisions taken by a comp etent author ity of a Member State, giving \neffect to such Union law. This Directive should specify which unlawful conduct is capable of constituting a criminal \noffence and, where appropr iate, set a quantitative or qualitative threshold necessar y for such conduct to constitute \na criminal offence. Such conduct should constitute a criminal offence when it is intentional and, in certain cases, also \nwhen carried out with at least serious negligence . In particular , unlawful conduct that causes  death of, or serious \ninjur y to, persons, substantial damage or a considerable risk of substantial damage to  environment or is \nconsidered other wise to be particularly harmful to  environment should also constitute a criminal offenc e when \ncarried out with at least serious negligence . Member States can adop t or maintain more stringent rules in  area of \ncriminal law.\n(10) Conduct should be unlawful even where it is carried out under an author isation issued by a comp etent author ity of \na Member State if such author isation was obtained fraudulently or by corruption, extor tion or coercion. \nFurther more, holding such an author isation should not preclude  holder from being held criminally liable, where \n author isation is in manif est breach of relevant substantive legal requirements. �\x80\x98In manifest breach of relevant \nsubstantive legal requirements�\x80\x99 should be interpreted as referring to an obvious and substantial breach of relevant \nsubstantive legal requirements, and is not intended to include breach es of procedural requirements or minor \nelements of  author isation.

This should also cover \noblig ations of  holder of  author isation to update and renew such author isation.\n(12) With rega rd to offences and penalties defined in this Directive,  term �\x80\x98legal persons�\x80\x99 should be understo od as not \nincluding States or public bodies exercising State author ity or public international organi sations. As this Directive \nestablishes minimum rules, Member States can adop t more stringent rules, including rules on criminal liability for \npublic bodies.\n(13) Some criminal offenc es defined in this Directive include a qualitative threshold for  conduct to constitute \na criminal offence, namely that such conduct causes  death of, or serious injur y to, a person or substantial \ndamage to  quality of air, water or soil, or to an ecosystem, animals or plants. In order to prot ect  environment \nto  fullest extent possible, that qualitative threshold should be understoo d in a broad sense including, where \nrelevant, substantial damage to fauna and flora, habitats, to services provid ed by natural resources and by ecosyste ms \nas well as to ecosystem functions. The term �\x80\x98ecosystem�\x80\x99 should be understoo d as a dynamic comp lex of plant, \nanimal, fungi and microorganism communities and their non-living envir onment, interacting as a functional unit, \nand should include habitat types, habitats of species and species populations. An ecosystem should also include \necosyst em services, through which an ecosyste m contr ibut es directly or indirectly to human wellbeing, and \necosyst em functions, which refer to natural processes in an ecosystem. Smaller units such as a beehive, an anthill or \na stump can be a part of an ecosystem but should not be considered to be an ecosystem in its own right for  \npurposes of this Directive.\n(14) For  purposes of this Directive,  term �\x80\x98injur y�\x80\x99 should be understood in a broad sense, that is as covering any \nform of physica l harm to a person, including a chang e in body function or cell structure, a temporar y, chronic or \nfatal disease, a malfunction of  body or other deterioration of phys ical health, but excluding mental health.\n(15) The introduction of different forms of energy , such as heat, sources of ther mal energy , noise, including under water \nnoise, and other sources of acoustic energy , vibrations, electromagnetic fields, electr icity or light, into  \nenvironment can cause substantial damage to  quality of air, wate r or soil or substantial damage to an ecosyste m, \nanimals or plants, or  death of, or serious injur y to, persons. Various instr uments of Union environmental law \nregulat e  introduction of energy into  envir onment, for example in  areas of protect ion of wate r,  mar ine \nenvironment, noise control, waste management and industr ial emissions. In light of those instr uments,  unlawful \nintroduction of energy into  envir onment should constitute a criminal offence under this Directive if it causes or \nis likely to cause substantial damage to  environment or human health.\n(16) Where criminal offences defined in this Directive relate to conduct such as making available or placing on  \nmark et, sale, offer ing for sale or trading, conduct carried out by means of information and communication \ntechnologies should be included.\n(17) This Directive introduces  criminal offence of  placing on  market, in breach of a prohibition or another \nrequirement aimed at prot ecting  envir onment, of a product  use of which on a larger scale results in  \ndisch arge, emission or introduction of a quantity of mat erials or substances, energy or ionising radiation into air, soil \nor water , and causes or is likely to cause substantial damage to  environment or human health. In that context, \na prohibition or another requirement aimed at protecting  envir onment should be one that is laid down in  \narea of Union law which has among its stated objectives, or has as an aim,  protection of  envir onment, \nincluding preser ving, prot ecting and impro ving  quality of  environment, prot ecting human health, prudent OJ L, 30.4.2024 EN\nELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2024/1203/oj 3/28', 'and rational utilisation of natural resources or combatting climate change, or promoting measures at international \nlevel to deal with regional or worldwide environmental problems. Conve rsely , where such a prohibition or \nrequirement is laid down in other areas of Union law which have other objectives, for exam ple prot ection of \nworke rs�\x80\x99 health and safety,  conduct should not be covered under that criminal offence. For  purpose of this \nDirective, �\x80\x98use on a larger scale�\x80\x99 refers to  combined effect of  use of  product by several users, regard less of \ntheir number , provided that  conduct causes or is likely to cause damage to  environment or human health.\n(18) Unla wful collection, transpor t and treatment of waste and  lack of super vision of such operations and of  \nafter-care of disposal sites, including action taken as a dealer or a brok er, can cause devastating effects on  \nenvironment and human health. Such effects can be caused by unla wful conduct which concer ns harmful waste \nfrom phar maceutical products, narcotic drugs, including comp onents to produce narcotic drugs, chemicals, waste \ncontaining acids or bases or wast e containing toxins, heavy metals, oil, grease, electr ical and electronic waste, \nend-of-life vehicles or plastic waste. Member States should, theref ore, ensure that unlawful waste management \nconstitute s a criminal offence where such conduct concer ns hazardous waste in a non-neg ligible quantity , or it \nconcer ns other wast e and such other waste causes or is likely to cause substantial damage to  envir onment or \nhuman health.\n(19) For  purpose of  criminal offence introduced by this Directive in relation to recy cling of ships falling within  \nscope of Regulation  No 1257/2013 of  European Parliament and of  Council (6) it is to be noted that, \ncurrently under Union law,  oblig ations set out in that Regulation only apply to ship owners, as defined in that \nRegulation.\n(20) With rega rd to  assessment of whether  quantity of a relevant product or relevant commodity associated with \ndeforestation or forest degradation as referred to in Regulation  2023/1115 of  European Parliame nt and of \n Council (7), is negligible, Member States could take into account, for example,  quantity of  relevant \ncommodity or product expressed in net mass, or, where applicable, in volume or as a number of items, or whether \n scale of  activity in question is negligible in terms of quantity . For such assessment, Member States could also \ntake into account, where relevant, other elements listed in this Directive for certain criminal offenc es, including  \nconser vation status of  species concer ned or  cost of restor ation of  environment.\n(21) Criminal offences relating to intentional conduct listed in this Directive can lead to catastrophic results, such as \nwidespread pollution, industr ial accidents with severe effects on  envir onment or large-scale forest fires. Where \nsuch offences cause  destr uction of, or widespread and substantial damage which is either irreversible or \nlong-lasting to, an ecosystem of considerable size or envir onmental value or a habitat within a prot ected site, or \ncause widespread and substantial damage which is either irreversible or long-lasting to  quality of air, soil, or \nwater, such offences, leading to such catastrophic results, should constitute qualif ied criminal offences and, \nconsequently , be punished with more severe penalties than those applicable in  event of other criminal offences \ndefined in this Directive. Those qualif ied criminal offences can encompass conduct comparable to �\x80\x98ecocide�\x80\x99, which is \nalready covered by  law of certain Member States and which is being discussed in international fora.\n(22) Where, under this Directive, conduct constitute s a criminal offence only if it concer ns a non-neg ligible quantity , \ncorresponding to  exceeding of a regulato ry threshold, value or other mandator y parameter , in assessing whether \nthat threshold, value or other parameter has been exceeded,  hazardousness and toxicity , inter alia, of  material \nor substance should be taken into account because  more hazardous or toxic  material or substance is,  \nsooner that threshold, value or other parameter is reac hed and, in  case of particularly hazardous and toxic \nsubstances or mat erials, even a very small quantity can cause substantial damage to  envir onment or human \nhealth.EN OJ L, 30.4.2024\n4/28 ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2024/1203/oj(6) Regulation  No 1257/2013 of  European Parliament and of  Council of 20 November 2013 on ship recy cling and \namending Regulation  No 1013/2006 and Directive 2009/16/EC (OJ L 330, 10.12.2013, p. 1).\n(7) Regulation  2023/1115 of  European Parliament and of  Council of 31 May 2023 on  making available on  Union \nmark et and  expor t from  Union of certain commodities and products associat ed with deforestation and forest degradation \nand repealing Regulation  No 995/2010 (OJ L 150, 9.6.2023, p. 206).', '(23) The acceleration of climate change, biodiversity loss and environmental degradation, paired with tangible examples \nof their devastating effects, have led to  recognition of  green transition as  defining objective of our time \nand a matter of interg enerational equity . Where this Directive, in order to define criminal offences, uses terms \ndefined in Union environmental law to descr ibe unla wful conduct, such terms should be understood within  \nmeaning of  corresponding definitions laid down in  relevant Union legal acts covered by this Directive. This \nDirective should also cover any Union acts that amend provisions or requirements relevant to descr ibing unlawful \nconduct which falls within  scope of criminal offences defined in this Directive. When draf ting such amending \nUnion acts, it would be appropr iate to include a reference to this Directive. However , where new types of unlawful \nconduct, not yet covered by  scope of  offences defined in this Directive, are introduced in Union \nenvironmental law, this Directive should be amended to include such new types of unla wful conduct within its \nscope.\n(24) Without prejudice to that dynamic nature of this Directive,  Commission should regularly , and where necessar y, \nconsider if there is a need to amend  descr iption in this Directive of conduct capable of constituting a criminal \noffence under this Directive. The Commission should also consider if there is a need to define other criminal \noffences when new types of unlawful conduct not yet covered by  scope of this Directive are introduced in Union \nenvironmental law.\n(25) This Directive should provid e a non-exhaustive list of elements which should be take n into account, where relevant, \nby  comp etent author ities, in assessing whether  qualitative and quantitative thresholds used to define \nenvironmental criminal offences have been reac hed. Provi ding such a list should facilitate  coherent application of \nthis Directive and a more effective fight against envir onmental crime as well as provide for lega l certainty . How ever , \nsuch assessment elements or their application should not make  detection, investigation, prosecution or \nadjudication of criminal offences excessively difficult.\n(26) Where this Directive provides that an unla wful conduct only constitutes a criminal offence where it is carried out \nintentionally and causes  death of a person,  notion of �\x80\x98intention�\x80\x99 should be interpreted in accordance with \nnational law, taking into account relevant case law of  Cour t of Justice of  European Union ( �\x80\x98Cour t of \nJustice�\x80\x99).Theref ore, for  purposes of this Directive, �\x80\x98intention�\x80\x99 could be understoo d as  intention to cause  \ndeath of a person, or it could also cover a situation in which  offender , despite not wanting to cause  death of \na person, never theless accepts  likelihood of causing it, and acts, or refrains from acting, voluntarily and in \nviolation of a particular obligati on, thereby causing  death of a person. The same understanding as regard s  \nnotion of �\x80\x98intention�\x80\x99 should apply where unla wful conduct descr ibed in this Directive, which is intentional, causes \nserious injur y to any person, or  destr uction of, or widespread and substantial damage which is either irreversible \nor long-lasting to, an ecosyste m of considerable size or environmental value or a habitat within a prot ected site, or \ncauses widespread and substantial damage which is either irreversible or long-lasting to  quality of air, soil, or \nwater.\n(27) With regard to  criminal offenc es defined in this Directive,  notion of �\x80\x98serious negligence �\x80\x99 should be interpreted \nin accordance with national law, taking into account relevant case law of  Cour t of Justice. This Directive does not \nrequire  introduction in national law of  notion of �\x80\x98serious negligence�\x80\x99 for each constituent element of  \ncriminal offence, such as possession, sale or offering for sale, placing on  mark et and similar elements. In such \ncases, it is possible for Member States to decide that  notion of �\x80\x98serious negligence�\x80\x99 is relevant for elements of  \ncriminal offenc e such as  prot ection status, �\x80\x98neg ligible quantity�\x80\x99, or  �\x80\x98likelihood�\x80\x99 of  conduct to cause \nsubstantial damage .\n(28) In criminal proceedings and trials, due account should be take n of  involvement of organised criminal groups \noperating in ways that nega tively impact  envir onment. Criminal proceedings for environmental offences should \naddress corrupti on, money launder ing, cyber -crime and document fraud and, in relation to business activities,  \nintention of  offender to maximise profits or save expenses. Such forms of crime are often interconnect ed with \nserious forms of environmental crime and should theref ore not be dealt with in isolation. They are also prone, in \nparticular , to causing substantial damage to  envir onment and human health, including devastating effects on \nnature and local communities. In addition, it is of particular concer n that some environmental criminal offences are \ncommitt ed with  tolerance or active suppor t of  compet ent administrations or officials perfo rming their public \nduty . In certain cases, this can even take  form of corruption. Examples of such behavi our are turning a blind eye OJ L, 30.4.2024 EN\nELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2024/1203/oj 5/28', 'to, or remaining silent on,  infringem ent of envir onmental law following inspections, deliberat ely omitting \ninspections or controls such as with regard to whether  conditions of a permit are being respected by  \npermit-holder , suppor ting resolutions or voting in favour of granting illega l licences, or issuing falsif ied or untr ue \nfavourable repor ts.\n(29) Inciting, and aiding and abetting intent ional commission of a criminal offence should also be punishable. An attempt \nto commit a criminal offenc e that causes or is likely to cause  death of, or serious injur y to, any person or causes \nor is likely to cause substantial damage to  environment or is other wise considered particularly harmful should \nalso constitute a criminal offence when committ ed intentionally . The notion of �\x80\x98attem pt�\x80\x99 is interpreted in accordance \nwith national law. With rega rd to  criminal offence defined in this Directive in relation to  execution of \na project without a development consent, since  executi on of a project is to be understood as including  start \nof  implementation of such a project, for exam ple works to prepare  ground for constr uction or other \nintervention with effects on  environment, this Directive does not list that offence among criminal offenc es for \nwhich an attem pt should be punishable as a criminal offenc e.\n(30) Penalties for  criminal offences defined in this Directive should be effective, dissuasive and propor tionate . To that \nend, minimum levels for  maximum term of impri sonment should be set for natural persons. The maximum \nterms of imprisonment provid ed for in this Directive for  criminal offences committed by natural persons should \napply at least to  most serious forms of such offences. The criminal law of all Member States includes provis ions \non homicide, either committ ed intentionally or with serious negligence . Member States should be able to have \nrecourse to those general provis ions, including provis ions on aggra vating circumstances, when transposing  \nprovisions in this Directive that relate to criminal offences that cause  death of a person, whether committ ed \nintentionally or with serious negligence .\n(31) Accessor y penalties or measures are often seen as being more effective than financ ial penalties, especially for legal \npersons. Accessor y penalties or measures should be theref ore available in  relevant proceedings. Those penalties \nor measures could include  obligati on to restor e  envir onment,  exclusion from access to public funding, \nincluding tender procedures, grants and concessions, and  withdra wal of permits and author isations. This is \nwithout prejudice to  discretion of judg es or cour ts in criminal proceedings to imp ose appropr iate penalties in \nindividual cases.\n(32) Accessor y penalties or measures could, without prejudice to  requirements of Directive 2004/35/EC of  \nEuropean Parliament and of  Council (8), include a requirement to resto re  environment where  damage is \nreversible and a requirement to provide comp ensation where  damage is irreversible or  offender lacks  \ncapacity to carry out such restoration.\n(33) To  exte nt that conduct constituting an envir onmental criminal offence as defined in this Directive is attributable \nto legal persons, such lega l persons should be held liable for such an offence. In order to achieve  objectives of this \nDirective, Member States whose law provides for  criminal liability of lega l persons should ensure that their law \nprovides for effective, dissuasive and propor tionate types and levels of criminal penalties as laid down in this \nDirective. In order to achieve  objectives of this Directive, Member States whose law does not provid e for  \ncriminal liability of lega l persons should ensure that their law provid es for effective, dissuasive and propor tionate \ntypes and levels of non-cr iminal penalties as laid down in this Directive. The maximum levels of fines provid ed for in \nthis Directive for  criminal offences defined in it should apply at least to  most serious forms of such offences. \nThe gravity of  conduct, as well as  individual, financial and other circumstances of  lega l persons \nconcer ned, should be taken into account to ensure that  penalty imp osed is effective, dissuasive and \npropor tionate. Member States should be able to set  maximum levels of fines either as a percentage of  total \nworldwide turnove r of  lega l person concer ned, or in fixed amounts. Member States should decide which of those \ntwo options they will use, when transposing this Directive.EN OJ L, 30.4.2024\n6/28 ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2024/1203/oj(8) Directive 2004/35/EC of  European Parliament and of  Council of 21 Apr il 2004 on environmental liability with regard to  \nprevention and remedying of environmental damage (OJ L 143, 30.4.2004, p. 56).', '(34) Where Member States, in  determinat ion of fines to be imposed on lega l persons, opt to implement  criterion \nof  total worldwide turnove r of a lega l person, they should decide whether to calculate that turnover based on  \nbusiness year preceding that in which  criminal offence was committed, or on  business year preceding that of \n decision to imp ose  fine. They should also consider provid ing for rules for cases where it is not possible to \ndetermine  amount of a fine on  basis of  total worldwide turnover of  lega l person in  business year \npreceding that in which  criminal offenc e was committ ed, or in  business year preceding that of  decision to \nimpose  fine. In such cases, Member States should be able to take into account other criteria, such as total \nworldwide turnove r in a different business year. Where those rules include  setting of fixed amounts of fines, it \nshould not be necessar y for  maximum levels of those amounts to reac h  levels established in this Directive as \n minimum requirement for  maximum level of fines set in fixed amounts.\n(35) Where Member States opt for a maximum level of fines set in fixed amounts, such levels should be laid down in \nnational law. The highest levels of such fines should apply to  most serious forms of criminal offences defined in \nthis Directive committed by lega l persons of financial strength. Member States should be able to determi ne  \nmethod of calculation of those highest levels of fines, including specif ic conditions theref or. Member States are \ninvited to regularly review  levels of fines set in fixed amounts having rega rd to rates of inflation and other \nfluctuations in monetar y value, in accordance with procedures laid down in their national law.

A given Member State should establish jurisdiction over criminal offences \ncommitt ed on board a ship or an aircraf t registered in that Member State, or flying its flag, taking into account \nrelate d standards under relevant international conventions. Member States should not be obliged under this \nDirective to establish for  first time such jurisdiction over criminal offences that, due to their nature, cannot be \ncommitt ed on board a ship or an aircraf t.\n(52) Member States should establish jurisdiction over criminal offences defined in this Directive where  damage which \nis one of  constituent elements of  criminal offence occur red on their territory .

The notion of �\x80\x98members of  public \nconcer ned�\x80\x99 and of �\x80\x98victims�\x80\x99 should remain distinct and Member States should not be required to apply victims�\x80\x99 rights \nto members of  public concer ned.
